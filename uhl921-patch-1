Airbrake Notifer for Android
===========================

Overview
--------
The Airbrake notifier for Android is designed to give you instant notification
of any uncaught exceptions thrown from your Android applications.


Building from Source
--------------------
To build a `.jar` file from source, make a clone of the airbrake-android
github repository and run:

```shell
ant package
```

This will generate a file named `build/airbrake-android-<version>.jar`.


Installation & Setup
--------------------
Copy the .jar file to your Android app's `libs/` folder.

Import the `AirbrakeNotifier` class in your app's main Activity.

```java
import com.loopj.android.airbrake.AirbrakeNotifier;
```

In your activity's `onCreate` function, register to begin capturing exceptions:

```java
AirbrakeNotifier.register(this, "your-api-key-goes-here");
```


Configuration
-------------
The `AirbrakeNotifier.register` call requires a context and Airbrake API key to
be passed in, and optionally a third argument specifying the environment.
The environment defaults to `production` if not set.

To notify Airbrake of non-fatal exceptions, or exceptions you have explicitly
caught in your app, you can call `AirbrakeNotifier.notify`. This call takes
exactly one argument, a Throwable, and can be called from anywhere in your
code. For example:

```java
try {
    // Something dangerous
} catch(Exception e) {
    // We don't want this to crash our app, but we would like to be notified
    AirbrakeNotifier.notify(e);
}
```
